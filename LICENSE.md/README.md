Weighted grade calculation
The weighted grade is equal to the sum of the product of the weights (w) in percent (%) times the grade (g):
Weighted grade = w1×g1+ w2×g2+ w3×g3+...
Example

Math course with grade of 80 and weight of 30%.
Biology course with grade of 90 and weight of 50%.
History course with grade of 72 and weight of 20%.
The weighted average grade is calculated by:
Weighted grade =
 = w1×g1+ w2×g2+ w3×g3
 = 30%×80+ 50%×90+ 20%×72 = 83.4

When the weights are not in percent (hours or points...), you should also divided by the sum of the weights:
Weighted grade = (w1×g1+ w2×g2+ w3×g3+...) / (w1+w2+w3+...)
Example

3 points Math course with grade of 80.
5 points Biology course with grade of 90.
2 points History course with grade of 72.
The weighted average grade is calculated by:
Weighted grade =
 = (w1×g1+ w2×g2+ w3×g3) / (w1+w2+w3)
 = (3×80+ 5×90+ 2×72) / (3+5+2) = 83.4
